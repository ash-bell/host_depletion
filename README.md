## Abstract
Microbiomes on fish mucosal surfaces play a crucial role in nutrient absorption and immune priming. Disruptions in these microbial communities can lead to adverse health outcomes for the fish. Studying fish microbiomes relies on sequencing microbiota within fish mucosal samples. However,  DNA extraction from these samples predominantly comprised of host DNA, making subsequent bioinformatic processes difficult. Host depletion techniques aim to address this issue by selectively degrading host DNA before sequencing. These techniques typically involve degrading host cells and DNA before extraction or retaining bacterial DNA post-extraction. However, their application on fish mucosal samples has been largely unexplored. In this study, the efficacy of various host depletion techniques on fish skin mucosal swabs is evaluated. Surprisingly, none of the existing methods effectively reduced host DNA to a useful degree. Furthermore, these techniques introduce a bias in the bacterial community composition, extracting biased microbe communities unrepresentative of the true fish skin microbiome. Specifically, some methods are biased towards the Bacilli class and Proteobacteria phylum. These findings suggest that the assessed host depletion techniques are ineffective for reducing host DNA in fish mucosal samples.  This is a major limitation in understanding the functional composition of fish mucosal microbiomes. Enriching microbiota (and excluding host DNA) is fundamental for cost-effective metagenomic studies and facilitating more accurate analyses of the microbiota metabolome and proteome.
